Currently, I am a PhD candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, starting from September 2022, and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). Prior to this, I earned my master's degree in 2022 at Xidian University, luckily under the supervision of Prof. [Jing Liu](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/liujing/). Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in 2019 at Xidian University.
